# iot-device-simulation-protocol-comparison
Simulate a small-scale IoT system that connects multiple devices to a central collector. The goal is to explore different IoT communication protocols (HTTP/REST &amp; MQTT), analyze scalability, and visualize system behavior. This repo showcases IoT basics: device simulation, protocol layers, data storage, and visualization.
